<!-- Do not include the issue number in the title. Give a brief
description of what was changed; someone interested in that
area of SymPy is more likely to review your work. -->


#### References to other Issues or PRs
<!-- Include references to related issues or PRs here.
Refer to issues or PRs in your discussion by typing '#' before
the number of the issue/PR, e.g. "...this is related to issue #12345".
Use the words like "fix", "close" or "resolve" before the issue number only
if the issue should be closed if this PR is merged. For example, issues
3, 12 and 42 would be closed if this opening paragraph said,
"This PR will fix #3. It resolves #12. It closed #42." -->
