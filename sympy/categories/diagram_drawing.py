    Constructs and holds the fitting of the diagram into a grid.

    The constructor of this class takes a :class:`Diagram` as an
    argument and fits it into a grid.  It is then possible to find the
    with and height of the grid using the properties ``width`` and
    ``height``, as well as accessing the objects located at certain
    coordinates and finding out which moprhisms connect the object
    with other objects in the grid.  TODO: Explain how to do that.
