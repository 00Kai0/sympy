Classical ciphers and LFSRs

In a *substitution cipher* "units" (not necessarily single characters)
of plaintext are replaced with ciphertext according to a regular system.

A *transposition cipher* is a method of encryption by which
the positions held by "units" of plaintext are replaced by a
permutation of the plaintext. That is, the order of the units is
changed using a bijective function on the position of the characters
to perform the encryption.

A *monoalphabetic cipher* uses fixed substitution over the entire
message, whereas a *polyalphabetic cipher* uses a number of substitutions
at different times in the message.

    This is a more general than the affine cipher in that the key can only
    be recovered by determining the mapping for each symbol. Though in
    practice, once a few symbols are recognized the mappings for other
    characters can be guessed quickly.

    Although single characters are replaced with single characters in this

######################################################################

def encipher_vigenere(pt, key, symbols=None):
    """
    Performs the Vigenère cipher encryption on plaintext ``pt``, and returns the ciphertext.

    Notes
    =====

    The Vigenère cipher is named after Blaise de Vigenère, a sixteenth
    century diplomat and cryptographer, by a historical accident.
    Vigenère actually invented a different and more complicated cipher.
    The so-called *Vigenère cipher* was actually invented
    by Giovan Batista Belaso in 1553.

    This cipher was used in the 1800's, for example, during the American Civil War.
    The Confederacy used a brass cipher disk to implement the Vigenère cipher
    (now on display in the NSA Museum in Fort Meade) [1]_.

    The Vigenère cipher is a generalization of the shift cipher.
    Whereas the shift cipher shifts each letter by the same amount (that amount
    being the key of the shift cipher) the Vigenère cipher shifts
    a letter by an amount determined by the key (which is a word or
    phrase known only to the sender and receiver).

    For example, if the key was a single letter, such as "C", then the
    so-called Vigenere cipher is actually a shift cipher with a
    shift of `2` (since "C" is the 2nd letter of the alphabet, if
    you start counting at `0`). If the key was a word with two
    letters, such as "CA", then the so-called Vigenère cipher will
    shift letters in even positions by `2` and letters in odd positions
    are left alone (shifted by `0`, since "A" is the 0th letter, if
    you start counting at `0`).


    ALGORITHM:

        INPUT:

            ``key``: a string of upper-case letters (the secret key)

            ``m``: string of upper-case letters (the plaintext message)

        OUTPUT:

            ``c``: string of upper-case letters (the ciphertext message)

        STEPS:
            0. Identify the alphabet A, ..., Z with the integers 0, ..., 25.
            1. Compute from the string ``key`` a list ``L1`` of corresponding
               integers. Let ``n1 = len(L1)``.
            2. Compute from the string ``m`` a list ``L2`` of corresponding
               integers. Let ``n2 = len(L2)``.
            3. Break ``L2`` up sequencially into sublists of size ``n1``, and one sublist
               at the end of size smaller or equal to ``n1``.
            4. For each of these sublists ``L`` of ``L2``, compute a new list ``C`` given by
               ``C[i] = L[i] + L1[i] (mod 26)`` to the ``i``-th element in the sublist,
               for each ``i``.
            5. Assemble these lists ``C`` by concatenation into a new list of length ``n2``.
            6. Compute from the new list a string ``c`` of corresponding letters.

    Once it is known that the key is, say, `n` characters long, frequency analysis
    can be applied to every `n`-th letter of the ciphertext to determine the plaintext.
    This method is called *Kasiski examination* (although it was first discovered
    by Babbage).

    The cipher Vigenère actually discovered is an "auto-key" cipher
    described as follows.

    ALGORITHM:

        INPUT:

          ``key``: a string of letters (the secret key)

          ``m``: string of letters (the plaintext message)

        OUTPUT:

          ``c``: string of upper-case letters (the ciphertext message)

        STEPS:
            0. Identify the alphabet A, ..., Z with the integers 0, ..., 25.
            1. Compute from the string ``m`` a list ``L2`` of corresponding
               integers. Let ``n2 = len(L2)``.
            2. Let ``n1`` be the length of the key. Concatenate the string
               ``key`` with the first ``n2 - n1`` characters of the plaintext message.
               Compute from this string of length ``n2`` a list ``L1`` of corresponding
               integers. Note ``n2 = len(L1)``.
            3. Compute a new list ``C`` given by ``C[i] = L1[i] + L2[i] (mod 26)``,
               for each ``i``. Note ``n2 = len(C)``.
            4. Compute from the new list a string ``c`` of corresponding letters.

def encipher_hill(pt, key, symbols=None, pad=None):

    Performs the Hill cipher encryption on plaintext ``pt``, and returns the ciphertext.

    Notes
    =====

    The Hill cipher [1]_, invented by Lester S. Hill in the 1920's [2]_,
    was the first polygraphic cipher in which it was practical (though barely)
    to operate on more than three symbols at once. The following discussion assumes
    an elementary knowledge of matrices.

    First, each letter is first encoded as a number. We assume here that
    "A" `\leftrightarrow` 0, "B" `\leftrightarrow` 1, ..., "Z" `\leftrightarrow` 25.
    We denote the integers `\{0, 1, ..., 25\}`
    by `Z_{26}`. Suppose your message m consists of `n` capital letters, with no spaces.
    This may be regarded an `n`-tuple M of elements of `Z_{26}`. A key in the Hill cipher
    is a `k x k` matrix `K`, all of whose entries are in `Z_{26}`, such that the matrix
    `K` is invertible (ie, that the linear transformation `K: Z_{26}^k \rightarrow Z_{26}^k`
    is one-to-one).

    ALGORITHM:

        INPUT:

            ``key``: a `k x k` invertible matrix `K`, all of whose entries are in `Z_{26}`

            ``m``: string of `n` upper-case letters (the plaintext message)

            ``pad``: character (default "Q") to use to make length of text be a mutiple of ``m``

        OUTPUT:

            ``c``: string of upper-case letters (the ciphertext message)

        STEPS:
            0. Identify the alphabet A, ..., Z with the integers 0, ..., 25.
            1. Compute from the string ``m`` a list ``L`` of corresponding
               integers. Let ``n = len(L)``.
            2. Break the list ``L`` up into ``t = ceiling(n/k)`` sublists
               ``L_1``, ..., ``L_t`` of size ``k`` (where the last list might be
               "padded" by 0's to ensure it is size ``k``).
            3. Compute new list ``C_1``, ..., ``C_t`` given by ``C[i] = K*L_i``
               (arithmetic is done mod 26), for each ``i``.
            4. Concatenate these into a list ``C = C_1 + ... + C_t``.
            5. Compute from ``C`` a string ``c`` of corresponding letters.
               This has length ``k*t``.

def encipher_bifid5(pt, key):
    r"""
    Performs the Bifid cipher encryption on plaintext ``pt``, and returns the ciphertext.

    This is the version of the Bifid cipher that uses the `5 \times 5` Polybius square.
    The letter "J" is replaced with "I" unless a ``key`` of length 25 is used.

    Notes
    =====

    The Bifid cipher was invented around 1901 by Felix Delastelle.
    It is a *fractional substitution* cipher, where letters are
    replaced by pairs of symbols from a smaller alphabet. The
    cipher uses a `5 \times 5` square filled with some ordering of the alphabet,
    except that "I" is used for "J" (this is a so-called
    Polybius square; there is a `6 \times 6` analog if you add back in "j" and also
    append onto the usual 26 letter alphabet, the digits 0, 1, ..., 9).
    According to Helen Gaines' book *Cryptanalysis*, this type of cipher
    was used in the field by the German Army during World War I.

    ALGORITHM: (5x5 case)

        INPUT:

            ``pt``: plaintext string; characters not in ``key`` are ignored

            ``key``: short string for key; duplicated characters are
            ignored and if the length is less then 25 characters, it
            will be padded with other letters from the alphabet omitting
            "J". Non-alphabetic characters are ignored.

        OUTPUT:

            ciphertext (all caps, no spaces)

        STEPS:
            1. Create the `5 \times 5` Polybius square ``S`` associated to the ``k`` as
               follows:

                a) starting top left, moving left-to-right, top-to-bottom,
                   place the letters of the key into a `5 \times 5` matrix,
                b) when finished, add the letters of the alphabet
                   not in the key until the `5 \times 5` square is filled. A
                   ``key`` 25 characters will (of course) completely
                   fill the square.

            2. Create a list ``P`` of pairs of numbers which are the coordinates
               in the Polybius square of the letters in ``pt``.
            3. Let ``L1`` be the list of all first coordinates of ``P`` (length
               of ``L1 = n``), let ``L2`` be the list of all second coordinates
               of ``P`` (so the length of ``L2`` is also ``n``).
            4. Let ``L`` be the concatenation of ``L1`` and ``L2`` (length ``L = 2*n``),
               except that consecutive numbers are paired ``(L[2*i], L[2*i + 1])``.
               You can regard ``L`` as a list of pairs of length ``n``.
            5. Let ``C`` be the list of all letters which are of the form
               ``S[i, j]``, for all ``(i, j)`` in ``L``. As a string, this
               is the ciphertext ``ct``.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy.crypto.crypto import encipher_bifid5 as f, decipher_bifid5 as F

def lfsr_sequence(key, fill, n):
    r"""
    This function creates an lfsr sequence.

    INPUT:

        ``key``: a list of finite field elements,
            `[c_0, c_1, \ldots, c_k].`

        ``fill``: the list of the initial terms of the lfsr
            sequence, `[x_0, x_1, \ldots, x_k].`

        ``n``: number of terms of the sequence that the
            function returns.

    OUTPUT:

        The lfsr sequence defined by `x_{n+1} = c_k x_n + \ldots + c_0 x_{n-k}`, for
        `n \leq k`.

    Notes
    =====

    S. Golomb [G]_ gives a list of three statistical properties a
    sequence of numbers `a = \{a_n\}_{n=1}^\infty`,
    `a_n \in \{0,1\}`, should display to be considered
    "random". Define the autocorrelation of `a` to be

    .. math::

        C(k) = C(k,a) = \lim_{N\rightarrow \infty} {1\over N}\sum_{n=1}^N (-1)^{a_n + a_{n+k}}.

    In the case where `a` is periodic with period
    `P` then this reduces to

    .. math::

        C(k) = {1\over P}\sum_{n=1}^P (-1)^{a_n + a_{n+k}}.

    Assume `a` is periodic with period `P`.

    - balance:

      .. math::

        \left|\sum_{n=1}^P(-1)^{a_n}\right| \leq 1.

    - low autocorrelation:

       .. math::

         C(k) = \left\{ \begin{array}{cc} 1,& k = 0,\\ \epsilon, & k \ne 0. \end{array} \right.

      (For sequences satisfying these first two properties, it is known
      that `\epsilon = -1/P` must hold.)

    - proportional runs property: In each period, half the runs have
      length `1`, one-fourth have length `2`, etc.
      Moreover, there are as many runs of `1`'s as there are of
      `0`'s.
