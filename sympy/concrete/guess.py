    This function is used internally by other functions from the
    sympy.concrete.guess module. While most users may want to rather use the
    function find_simple_recurrence when looking for recurrence relations
    among rational numbers, the current function may still be useful when
    some post-proecessing has to be done.

    The function returns a vector of length n when a recurrence relation of
    order n is detected in the sequence of rational numbers v.

    If the returned vector has a length 1, then the returned value is also [0],
    which means that no relation has been found.

    Helps identifying a rational number from a float (or mpmath.mpf) value by
    using a continued fraction. The algorithm stops as soon as a large partial
    quotient is detected (greater than 10000 by default).

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy.concrete.guess import rationalize
    >>> from mpmath import cos, pi
    >>> rationalize( cos(pi/3) )
    1/2

    While the function is rather intended to help 'identifying' rational
    values, it may be used in some cases for approximating real numbers.
    (Though other functions may be more relevant in that case.)

    >>> rationalize( pi, maxcoeff = 250 )
    355/113

    ========
    Several other methods can approximate a real number as a rational, like:

      * fractions.Fraction.from_decimal
      * fractions.Fraction.from_float
      * mpmath.identify
      * mpmath.pslq by using the following syntax: mpmath.pslq([x, 1])
      * mpmath.findpoly by using the following syntax: mpmath.findpoly(x,1)
      * sympy.simplify.nsimplify (which is a more general function)

    The main difference between the current function and all these variants is
    that control focuses on magnitude of partial quotients here rather than on
    global precision of the approximation. If the real is "known to be" a
    rational number, the current function should be able to detect it correctly
    with the default settings even when denominator is great (unless its
    expansion contains unusually big partial quotients) which may occur
    when studying sequences of increasing numbers. If the user cares more
    on getting simple fractions, other methods may be more convenient.
