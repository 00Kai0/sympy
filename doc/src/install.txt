Installation
------------

The SymPy CAS can be installed on virtually any computer with Python 2.5 or
above. SymPy does not require any special Python modules: let us know if you
have any problems with SymPy on a standard Python install. The current
recommended method of installation is directly from the source files.
Alternatively, executables are available for Windows, and some Linux
distributions have SymPy installed by default.

Source
======
SymPy currently recommends that users install directly from the source files.
You will first have to download the source files via the archive. Download the
latest release from the link_ and open it with your operating system's standard
decompression utility.

After the download is complete, you should have a folder called "sympy". From
your favorite command line terminal, change directory into that folder and
execute the following::

    $ python setup.py install

Alternatively, if you don't want to install the package onto your computer, you
may run SymPy with the "isympy" console (which auto-imports SymPy and defines
symbols x, y, and z) by executing within the "sympy" folder::

    $ ./bin/isympy

You may now run SymPy statements directly within the Python shell::

    >>> from __future__ import division
    >>> from sympy import *
    >>> x, y, z, t = symbols('x y z t')
    >>> k, m, n = symbols('k m n', integer=True)
    >>> f, g, h = symbols('f g h', cls=Function)
    >>> print diff(x**2/2, x)
    x

Git
===
If you are a developer or like to get the latest updates as they come, be sure
to install from git. To download the repository, execute the following from the
command line::

    $ git clone git://github.com/sympy/sympy.git

Then, execute either the setup.py or the bin/isympy scripts as demonstrated
above.

To update to the latest version, go into your repository and execute::

    $ git pull origin master

Other Methods
=============
An installation executable is available for Windows users. In addition, some
Linux distributions may already have the SymPy package installed. To check if
SymPy is present on your computer, execute::

    $ python
    >>> from sympy import *

If you get an error, SymPy is not installed. Windows users may want to use the
executable_. Others are strongly encouraged to download from source (detailed
above).

Run SymPy
=========
After installation, it is best to verify that your freshly-installed SymPy
works. To do this, start up Python and import the SymPy libraries::

    $ python
    >>> from sympy import *

From here, execute some simple SymPy statements like the ones below::

    >>> print limit(sin(x)/x, x, 0)
    1
    >>> print integrate(1/x, x)
    log(x)

For a starter guide on using SymPy effectively, refer to the tutorial_.

Questions
=========

If you have a question about installation or SymPy in general, feel free to

feel like there is an unresolvable problem with installation for your
environment, you may post an `issue ticket`_.
