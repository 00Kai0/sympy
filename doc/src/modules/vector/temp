Like vectors (and vector fields), scalar fields can also be re-expressed in
other frames of reference, apart from the one they were defined in â€“ assuming
that an orientation relationship exists between the concerned frames. This
can be done using the :mod:`express` method, in a way similar to vectors -
but with the :mod:`variables` parameter set to :mod:`True`.

  >>> from sympy.physics.vector import ReferenceFrame
  >>> R = ReferenceFrame('R')
  >>> electric_potential = 2*R[0]**2*R[1]
  >>> from sympy.physics.vector import dynamicsymbols, express
  >>> q = dynamicsymbols('q')
  >>> R1 = R.orientnew('R1', rot_type = 'Axis', amounts = [q, R.z])
  >>> express(electric_potential, R1, variables=True)
  2*(R1_x*sin(q(t)) + R1_y*cos(q(t)))*(R1_x*cos(q(t)) - R1_y*sin(q(t)))**2
