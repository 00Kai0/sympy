About Holonomic Function
========================

This text aims to explain what a Holonomic Function is.

Definition of Holonomic Function
---------------------------------

Holonomic Function is a very general type of function and includes a lot of
known functions in it. In fact more known Hypergeometric Function and
Meijer G-function are also a special case of it.

The mathematical definition of this function is pretty simple:

A Holonomic Function is a solution to an ordinary differential equation having
polynomial coefficients only. In this module the differential equation will be
represented by a Differential Operator annihilating the function.

Since solution of a Differential equation often consists of a family of
functions rather than a unique function it is generally advisable to give
initial conditions also when defining a Holonomic Function.
