This directory contains SymPy example programs.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DIRECTORY STRUCTURE

The examples are broken up into three categories based on difficulty of both
the mathematics and programming concepts.  They roughly follow the following
guide:

beginner :
  Simple examples appropriate for first steps in using SymPy, for someone
  with little or no programming experience.

intermediate :
  Demonstrations of more complex mathematical concepts, but still for
  someone with little programming experience.

advanced :
  Larger demonstrations of advanced mathematical topics.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RUNNING EXAMPLES

To run the examples one needs to have Python version >= 2.4 installed and SymPy
must be in your PYTHONPATH environment variable, alternatively you can run the
examples from the top sympy directory.  Most example can be run from the
command line python and the name of the example:

  aterrel@lilac:~/sympy$ python examples/beginner/basic.py
  (3*a*b**2)**c

or, with PYHTONPATH defined

  aterrel@lilac:~/sympy/examples$ export PYTHONPATH=$PWD/..:$PYTHONPATH
  aterrel@lilac:~/sympy/examples$ python beginner/basic.py
  (3*a*b**2)**c

All the working examples can be run by executing the "all.py" script, use
./all.py -h for usage, if an example is known to be broken it will be commented
out in this script.
