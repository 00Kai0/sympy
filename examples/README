This directory contains SymPy example programs.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DIRECTORY STRUCTURE

The examples are broken up into three categories based on difficulty of both
the mathematics and programming concepts.  They roughly follow the following
guide:

beginner :
  Simple examples appropriate for first steps in using SymPy, for someone
  with little or no programming experience.

intermediate :
  Demonstrations of more complex mathematical concepts, but still for
  someone with little programming experience.

advanced :
  Larger demonstrations of advanced mathematical topics.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RUNNING EXAMPLES

To run the examples one needs to have Python version >= 2.4 installed.  Each
example can be run from the command line python and the name of the example:

  aterrel@lilac:~/sympy/examples$ python beginner/basic.py
  (3*a*b**2)**c

All the working examples can be run by executing the "./all" script, if an
example is known to be broken it will be commented out in this script.
